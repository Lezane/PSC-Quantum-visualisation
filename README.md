PSC-Quantum-visualisation
It is a school project that we have built up during the year under Rodney Von Meter's directives. We are new in the Qiskit community and it is first time we develop a tool.
If you notice any bugs or other parts that we can improve, please contact us. (clement.lezane@polytechnique.edu or charles.gery@polytechnique.edu)


Make sure that you have already installed PyQt 5

To use it put this in the beginning of the the code:
import beautiful_tools

Then normally this will appear : 
finish importing colorBar
finish importing dial_set
finish importing dial_set_3d
finish importing pyqt
colorbar_display avaible
dial_set_display avaible
dial_set_3d_display avaible
pyqt_display avaible

and you use them on any quantum circuit :
beautiful_tools.approximation_display(qc)
